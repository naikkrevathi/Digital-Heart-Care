Digital Heart Care is a healthcare-based application designed to monitor and manage heart health digitally. It helps users track important health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and daily activity. The system can provide alerts, basic health insights, and reminders for regular checkups or medication. This project shows how technology can be used to support early detection, continuous monitoring, and better management of heart-related conditions, improving overall healthcare efficiency.
